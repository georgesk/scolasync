PREREQUISITES
=============

To INSTALL scolasync, first check dependencies. If you want to BUILD
scolasync, you need additional packages (build dependencies)

dependencies : 
  python3, python3-dbus, python3-pyqt4, python-pysqlite2, tango-icon-theme

build-dependencies:
  make 
  stuff providing development tools for qt4 and python3-qt4
  doxygen,  doxypy, graphviz to build the technical documentation in HTML
  texlive and related packages to add PDF docs
  xsltproc, docbook-xsl to build a manpage

To BUILD scolasync
==================

  run make.
  if all of the build dependencies are here, you will get a directory
  doc/ with all technical doc updated in it.
  language files and user interfaces files will be updated.

To RUN scolasync
================
  if you do not want to make scolasync available for everybody, you can
  just change to the directory src/ and launch the command:
  "python3 scolasync.py" or just: "scolasync.py"

  if you want scolasync to be installed for any user, a more careful
  method is needed. language files must be installed to /usr/share/scolasync/
  in a lang/ subdirectory, as well as other stuff: help files, images,
  html and pdf documents.

Files which scolasync will create when it is launched
=====================================================

  Scolasync will create a file "${HOME}/.scolasync/db"

  This file contains persistent data which are useful between two sessions
  of scolasync: for example, the naming of mobile media.

  If a file with this name exists, but was created with a previous version
  of scolasync, some issues may happen. If so, delete the file "db", and
  launch scolasync again. You will lose previous settings, but settings
  should be reset to valid defaults.
