A manual page <package>.<section> will be generated. You may view the
manual page with: nroff -man <package>.<section> | less'. A typical entry
in a Makefile or Makefile.am is:

DB2MAN = /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/docbook-xsl/manpages/docbook.xsl
XP     = xsltproc -''-nonet -''-param man.charmap.use.subset "0"

manpage.1: manpage.xml
        $(XP) $(DB2MAN) $<

The xsltproc binary is found in the xsltproc package. The XSL files are in
docbook-xsl. A description of the parameters you can use can be found in the
docbook-xsl-doc-* packages. Please remember that if you create the nroff
version in one of the debian/rules file targets (such as build), you will need
to include xsltproc and docbook-xsl in your Build-Depends control field.
Alternatively use the xmlto command/package. That will also automatically
pull in xsltproc and docbook-xsl.

Notes for using docbook2x: docbook2x-man does not automatically create the
AUTHOR(S) and COPYRIGHT sections. In this case, please add them manually as
<refsect1> ... </refsect1>.

To disable the automatic creation of the AUTHOR(S) and COPYRIGHT sections
read /usr/share/doc/docbook-xsl/doc/manpages/authors.html. This file can be
found in the docbook-xsl-doc-html package.

Validation can be done using: `xmllint -''-noout -''-valid manpage.xml`

    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> allows you to send a series of
    files towards a set of removable media. Every individual removable
    storage device is identified, for example to its owner. Then, later,
    you can retreive modified files from the same collection of removable 
    media and track the modifications attributable to each owner.

    they are given homework on their USB sticks, and they bring them back
    with modified contents to get scores.
